# 🚗 Used Car Price Prediction (Pakistan Market)

This project predicts **used car prices** based on scraped data from [Pakwheels](https://www.pakwheels.com/used-cars/).  
It demonstrates the **Data Science workflow**:  
data collection → cleaning → EDA → feature engineering → model building → evaluation.

## 📂 Project Workflow  

### 1. Web Scraping  
- Scraped car listings (title, price, year, mileage, fuel, transmission, engine, etc.)  
- Implemented pagination to scrape multiple pages.  
- Handled failed requests and optimized scraping for Colab environment.  
- Saved raw dataset as CSV for reproducibility.  

### 2. Data Cleaning  
- Removed duplicates & irrelevant columns (e.g., title).  
- Fixed column types (numeric conversion for price, mileage, engine size).  
- Handled missing values:
  - `engine_cc`, `battery_kwh` → imputed with `0` + missingness flag.  
  - No nulls in categorical columns.  
- Handled unrealistic values:
  - Mileage > 1,000,000 km → capped/dropped.  
  - Price spikes for old models (e.g., vintage cars) → handled as outliers.  

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Distribution plots of price, mileage, year.  
- Price vs Mileage scatterplots → identified depreciation trends.  
- Heatmap of numeric correlations.  
- Grouped analysis:
  - Price variation across **brands** (company).  
  - Price variation across **models**.  
- Detected multicollinearity with correlation & VIF.  

### 4. Feature Engineering  
- **Derived features:**
  - `car_age = CurrentYear - Year`  
  - `price_per_km = Price / Mileage`  
- **Transformations for skewed data:**  
  - Log / Box-Cox for mileage and price.  
- **Encoding:**  
  - One-Hot → fuel, transmission, engine_type, company  
  - Frequency Encoding → model  
- **Scaling:**  
  - RobustScaler for numeric features  

### 5. Modeling  
- Baseline models: Linear, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet  
- Tree-based models: Decision Tree, Random Forest  
- Boosting: AdaBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM  
- **Best model:**  
  - **LightGBM (tuned)**  
  - Cross-validated R²: ~0.90  
  - MAE: ~5.1 lacs
